Internship: Oasis Infobyte
Domain: Data Analytics
Project Type: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore McDonald’s menu data to understand the nutritional and pricing patterns of various food items.
Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover useful insights such as category-wise calorie distribution, sugar vs fat relationship, and nutritional correlations that support better decision-making.

🧠 Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removed missing values and duplicates, standardized column names.

Statistical Summary & Outlier Detection – Analyzed numerical features and identified potential outliers.

Data Visualization – Created bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize key nutritional trends.

Correlation Analysis – Examined relationships between calories, fat, protein, sugar, and other nutrients.

Business Insights & Recommendations – Summarized findings to improve product marketing and health awareness.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy
