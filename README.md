Internship: Oasis Infobyte | Domain: Data Analytics

ðŸ“˜ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore McDonaldâ€™s menu data to understand the nutritional and pricing patterns of various items. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover useful business insights such as category-wise calorie distribution, sugar vs fat relationship, and pricing trends.

ðŸ§  Key Steps

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Statistical Summary and Outlier Detection

Data Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Correlation and Relationship Analysis

Insights and Business Recommendations

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

High-calorie items mostly belong to Breakfast and Chicken & Fish categories.

Smoothies & Shakes contain the most sugar.

Salads and Beverages are the healthiest and lowest in calories.

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis helped uncover hidden patterns and provided actionable insights into McDonaldâ€™s nutritional data.
